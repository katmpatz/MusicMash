## Overview ü¶Ñ
Currently Spotify does not offer a solution for people at a party/gathering to customize songs based on the party mood, collaboratively add/remove songs or select the order of the playlist as a group. MusicMash provides a solution for this, where the party/event host can create a collaborative playlist which is automatically populated with music based on the selected mood of the event and then all the participants can get together, decide on the order of the songs by liking them, and play the music. Users can join the virtual party, search, and add their own songs as well. Highest liked songs will move to the top. Changes will be visible in real time across all users in the party.


## Setup üëâüèª

* Download node.js (v14.16.0) and npm (6.14.11) on your computer.

* Clone the project:
```
git clone git@gits-15.sys.kth.se:bacanu/MusicMash.git
```

* If you want to test our application locally, send an email to our group so we can send you the firebase config file.

* Put the firebaseConfig.js file inside the src/firebase folder.

* Rename env.local to .env.local

* Run the following commands from the music-mash-app directory:
```
npm install
``` 
```
npm start
```

## Beware
Before using the app, there are a few things to be aware of:
* Only Spotify Premium users can play songs.
* The player was implemented through [this](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spotify-web-playback) third-party component that uses the Spotify Web Playback SDK. The SDK is currently in Beta and was tested on Mac, Linux, and Windows, on Mozilla and Chrome. If you have Spotify Premium and still encounter errors with the player, check [this](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/) website for the list of supported browsers and functionalities.
* The application state (songs, song likes, party collaborators, the user's parties) is persisted in real time across users, as well as between one user's session in 2 different tabs/browsers. However, the application is meant to be a real-time music collaboration platform, so we recommend testing the persistence by having multiple users join the same party.
* If you encounter any errors or for some reason get stuck, try clearing your browser's local and session storage and logging back in.
